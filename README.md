# Snoozebox
Snoozebox is a sample site to outline my personal knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3 along with a potential testing ground of new methods and ways to utilize the language to create a better UX. 

Snoozebox is a fictional company, with any and all relations to real people, places, and things are wholly coincidental.
